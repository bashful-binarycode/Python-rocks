            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The World has changed a lot since early 2000's, rapidly enough that no even remembers using a smartphone.This is interesting and bizarre at the same time. Humans have a unique nature of always evolving to cope up with the changing environment, leaving everything behind and moving forward. Oh sorry, forgot to introduce myself, well technically I am not a complete robot so I do make mistakes. I am Patrick885e, the product of modern science. This is a record of the great human history since the Superiors came into existence. If you are interested to know, meet me under the Timeline tab......</p>
